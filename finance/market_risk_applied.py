We STRONGLY recommend using the .ipynb version instead of this .py version
The .ipynb has more explanatory notes to help and guide you through.

The .py version is largely designed for more intermediate / advanced users of
Python.

# Alternatively, estimate the covariance using np.cov()

# We can extract the covariance from the VCV using index slicing.
# The covariance is at index 1 within the first sublist (which is at index 0).
